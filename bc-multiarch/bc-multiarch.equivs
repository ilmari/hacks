Description: Dummy multiarch bc dependency package
 This package provides a dummy multi-arch bc and depends on the real
 one, so packages from other architectures that require bc can be
 installed even though the real bc isn't Multi-Arch: foreign.
 .
 It can be safely removed once a bc with Multi-Arch: foreign is
 installed.
